<h2>ERASMUS.</h2></div>


<p>Desiderius Erasmus was born at Rotterdam
on the 27th of October, 1467. His
father, Gerhard de Praet, belonged to a respectable
family at Gouda, a small town of
south Holland, not far from Rotterdam: his
mother, Margaret, was the daughter of a physician
at Sevenberg in Brabant. Gerhard's
parents were resolved that he should become
a monk. Meanwhile he was secretly betrothed
to Margaret. His family succeeded in preventing
their marriage, but not their union.
After the birth of a son&mdash;the elder and only
brother of Erasmus&mdash;Gerhard fled to Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
A false rumour of Margaret's death there induced
him, in his despair, to enter the priesthood.
On returning to Holland, he found
Margaret living at Gouda with his two boys.
He was true to the irrevocable vows which
parted him from her. After a few years, during
which the supervision of their children's education
had been a common solace, she died, while
still young; and Gerhard, broken-hearted, soon
followed her to the grave.</p>

<p>The boy afterwards so famous had been given
his father's Christian name, Gerhard, meaning
'beloved.' Desiderius is barbarous Latin for
that, and Erasmus is barbarous Greek for it. If
the great scholar devised those appellations for
himself, it must have been at an early age.
Afterwards, when he stood godfather to the son
of his friend Froben the printer, he gave the boy
the correct form of his own second name,&mdash;viz.,
Erasmius. The combination, Desiderius Erasmus,
is probably due to the fact that he had
been known as Gerhard Gerhardson. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
singular fortune for a master of literary style
to be designated by two words which mean
the same thing, and are both incorrect.</p>

<p>He was sent to school at Gouda when he
was four years old. Here it was perceived that
he had a fine voice; and so he was taken to
Utrecht, and placed in the Cathedral choir.
But he had no gift for music. At nine years of
age he was removed from Utrecht to a good
school at Deventer. His precocious genius soon
showed itself, and his future eminence was predicted
by the famous Rudolph Agricola&mdash;one of
the first men who brought the new learning
across the Alps.</p>

<p>Erasmus was only thirteen when he lost both
parents, and was left to the care of three guardians.
They wished him to become a monk: it
was the simplest way to dispose of a ward. The
boy loathed the idea; he knew his father's
story; and now it seemed as if the same shadow
was to fall on his own life also. However, the
guardians sent him to a monastic seminary at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Hertogenbosch, where the brethren undertook
to prepare youth for the cloister. The
three years which he spent there&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, from
thirteen to sixteen&mdash;were wholly wasted and
miserable: he learned nothing, and his health,
never strong, was injured by cruel severities.
'The plan of these men,' he said afterwards,
'when they see a boy of high and lively spirit, is
to break and humble it by stripes, by threats, by
reproaches, and various other means.' The
struggle with the monks and his guardians was
a long one; when menaces failed, they tried
blandishments,&mdash;especially they promised him a
paradise of literary leisure. At last he gave in.
When he was about eighteen, he took the vows
of a Canon Regular of the order of St Augustine.
Looking back afterwards on the arts by which
he had been won, he asks, 'What is kidnapping,
if this is not?'</p>

<p>The next five years&mdash;till he was twenty-three&mdash;were
spent in his monastery at Stein, near
Gouda. The general life of the place was odious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to him; but he found one friend, named William
Hermann. They used to read the Latin classics
together&mdash;secretly, for such studies were viewed
with some suspicion. It was then that he laid the
basis of his Latin style, and became thoroughly
familiar with some of the best Latin authors.</p>

<p>In 1491 he left the monastery, having been
invited by the Bishop of Cambray, Henry de
Bergis, to reside with him as his secretary. Soon
afterwards he took orders; and the Bishop
subsequently enabled him to enter the University
of Paris, for the purpose of studying
theology. He was then, perhaps, about twenty-seven
years of age.</p>

<p>At this point we may attempt,&mdash;aided by
Holbein, and by tradition&mdash;to form some idea
of his personal appearance. Erasmus was a
rather small man, slight, but well-built; he had,
as became a Teuton, blue eyes, yellowish or
light brown hair, and a fair complexion. The
face is a remarkable one. It has two chief
characteristics,&mdash;quiet, watchful sagacity,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
humour, half playful, half sarcastic. The eyes
are calm, critical, steadily observant, with a
half-latent twinkle in them; the nose is straight,
rather long, and pointed; the rippling curves of
the large mouth indicate a certain energetic
vivacity of temperament, and tenacity of purpose;
while the pose of the head suggests vigilant
caution, almost timidity. As we continue to
study the features, they speak more and more
clearly of insight and refinement; of a worldly
yet very gentle shrewdness; of cheerful self-mastery;
and of a mind which has its weapons
ready at every instant. But there is no suggestion
of enthusiasm,&mdash;unless it be the literary
enthusiasm of a student. It is difficult to
imagine those cool eyes kindled by any glow
of passion, or that genial serenity broken by a
spiritual struggle. This man, we feel, would be
an intellectual champion of truth and reason;
his wit might be as the spear of Ithuriel, and
his satire as the sword of Gideon; but he has
not the face of a hero or a martyr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>On entering the University of Paris, Erasmus
took up his residence at the Montaigu College. It
was on the south side of the Seine, not far from
the Sorbonne, and is said to have stood on the
site now occupied by the Library of St. Geneviève.
The Rector of the College was a man of
estimable character; but he believed in extreme
privation&mdash;which he had himself endured in
youth&mdash;as the best school for students of theology.
Erasmus has described the life there.
The work imposed on the students was excessively
severe. They were also half starved;
meat was proscribed altogether; eggs, usually
the reverse of fresh, formed the staple of
food; the inmates had to fetch their drinking
water from a polluted well. When wine was
allowed, it was such as implied by the
nickname 'Vinegar College' (a Latin pun on
Montaigu). Many of the sleeping-rooms were
on a ground-floor where the plaster was mouldering
on the damp walls, and in such a neighbourhood
that the air breathed by the sleepers&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>when
they could sleep&mdash;was pestilential. One
year's experience of this place&mdash;these are the
words of Erasmus&mdash;doomed many youths of
the brightest gifts and promise either to
death, or to blindness, or to madness, or to
leprosy; 'some of these,' he says, 'I knew
myself,&mdash;and assuredly every one of us ran
the danger.' Similar testimony is given by
his younger contemporary, Rabelais:&mdash;'The
unhappy creatures at that College are treated
worse than galley-slaves among the Moors
and Tartars, or than murderers in a criminal
prison.'</p>

<p>No wonder Erasmus, a delicate man at the
best, soon fell ill; indeed, his constitution was
permanently impaired. He went back to the
Bishop at Cambray. Then, after a short visit
to Holland, he returned to Paris&mdash;but not to
the Montaigu College. He rented a one-room
lodging, and resolved to support himself during
his University course by taking private pupils.
It was a hard struggle that he went through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
then; but better days were at hand. He had
already become known in Paris as a scholar of
brilliant promise, and especially as an admirable
Latinist. Latin was then the general language,
not only of learning, but of polite intercourse
between persons of different nationalities; and
to speak Latin with fluent grace&mdash;an art in
which Erasmus was already pre-eminent&mdash;was
the best passport to cultivated society in Paris,
whose University attracted students from all
countries. Then he had a bright and nimble
fancy, a keen sense of humour, a frank manner,
and also rare tact; in short, he was a delightful
companion, without ever seeking to dominate
his company. One of his pupils was a young
Englishman, William Blunt, Lord Mountjoy,
who was studying at Paris. Mountjoy settled
an annual pension of a hundred crowns on
Erasmus, and presently persuaded him to visit
England.</p>

<p>This was in 1498. Erasmus was now thirty-one.
For eighteen years&mdash;ever since he left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
school at Deventer&mdash;his life had been a hard
one. The coarse rigours of Hertogenbosch,
the midnight oil of Stein, the miseries of the
Montaigu College, the later battle with poverty
in Paris&mdash;all these had left their marks on that
slight form, and that keen, calm face. Men
who met him in England must have found it
difficult to believe that he was so young. The
sallow cheeks, the sunken eyes, the bent shoulders,
the worn air of the whole man seemed to
speak of a more advanced age. But neither
then, nor at any later time, was he other than
youthful in buoyant vivacity of spirit, in restless
activity of mind, in untiring capacity for work.</p>

<p>And now a new world opened before him.
In England he was not only an honoured guest,
but, for the first time, perhaps, since he left
school, he found himself among men from whom
he had something to learn. He went to Oxford,
with a letter of introduction to Richard Charnock,
Prior of a house of his own order, the Canons
Regular of St Augustine, and was hospitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
received by him in the College of St Mary the
Virgin. At that time the scholastic theology
and philosophy still held the field in both the
English Universities&mdash;as everywhere else, north
of the Alps. But at Oxford there were a few
eminent men who had studied the new learning
in Italy, and had brought the love for it home
with them. Erasmus was just too late to see
William Selling of All Souls College, who died
in 1495,&mdash;one of the first Englishmen who
endeavoured to introduce Greek studies in
this country. And he was too early to meet
William Lilly, who was still abroad then. But
he met some other scholars who were among
the earliest teachers or advocates of Greek at
Oxford,&mdash;William Grocyn, William Latimer, and
Thomas Linacre;&mdash;the last-named, who became
Founder of the Royal College of Physicians,
had studied at Florence under Politian and
Chalcondyles. Erasmus speaks with especial
praise of Grocyn's comprehensive learning, and
of Linacre's finished taste. It is certain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his intercourse with the Oxford Hellenists must
have been both instructive and stimulating to
him; we can see, too, that it strengthened his
desire to visit Italy. On the other hand, his
letters show that when he left Oxford in
1500, he had not advanced far in the study
of Greek. The years from 1500 to 1505,
during which he worked intensely hard at
Greek by himself in Paris, were those in which
his knowledge of that language was chiefly
built up.</p>

<p>The two Oxonians with whom Erasmus
formed the closest friendship were John Colet
and Thomas More. Colet was just a year his
senior, and was then lecturing on St Paul's
Epistles in what was quite a new way,&mdash;endeavouring
to bring out their meaning historically
and practically. He was not a Greek
scholar; but it was he who, more than anyone
else, encouraged Erasmus to print the New
Testament in the original tongue. Thomas
More, who was then a youth of twenty, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
left Oxford, and was reading law in London,
where Erasmus first met him. The story that
they met at dinner, and that, before an introduction,
each recognised the other by his wit, is
perhaps apocryphal. At any rate, it expresses
the truth that such perfectly congenial minds
would be drawn to each other at once.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1499 Erasmus visited Lord
Mountjoy at Greenwich. It would seem, too,
that he had a glimpse of Henry VII.'s Court.
He writes that he has become 'a better horse-man,
and a tolerable courtier.' In January,
1500, just before Erasmus left England, Thomas
More went down from London to Greenwich, to
say farewell,&mdash;bringing with him another young
lawyer named Arnold. More proposed a walk,
and took his friends to call at a large house in
the neighbouring village of Eltham. They were
shown into a hall where some children were at
play: it was, in fact, the royal nursery. The
eldest, a boy of nine years old, was the future
Henry VIII.; he was not then Prince of Wales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
but Duke of York, his brother Arthur being
still alive. The tutor in charge of the children
was John Skelton, the poet. Three days afterwards,
in fulfilment of a promise, Erasmus sent
the little Prince a Latin poem; it is in praise of
England, and of Henry VII. There is no
doubt that the praise of England came from his
heart: his letters show that.</p>

<p>At the end of January, 1500, he sailed from
Dover for France. A serious mishap befell him
just before he went on board. He carried with
him a considerable sum of money, contributed
by friends for the purpose of enabling him to
visit Italy. The custom-house officers at Dover
deprived him of nearly the whole, on plea of a
law forbidding the exportation of gold coin of
the realm above a certain amount. His friends
at court afterwards tried to recover it for him,&mdash;but
in vain. On reaching Paris, he fell ill.
When he recovered, he set hard to work. The
next five years were spent chiefly at Paris, with
occasional visits to Orleans or the Netherlands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
They form a quiet yet memorable period of his
life. In 1500 he published his first collection of
proverbial sayings from the classics,&mdash;the <i>Adagia</i>,&mdash;which,
in its enlarged form, afterwards brought
him so much fame. And during these years his
incessant labour at Greek gradually qualified
him for yet greater tasks. He had no teacher in
Paris; and, though not absolutely in want, he
had difficulty in buying all the books that he
required.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1505 Erasmus paid a
second visit to England,&mdash;staying only about
six months. On this occasion he visited Cambridge.
The Grace Book of our University
shows that permission was given to Desiderius
Erasmus to take the degrees of B.D. and D.D.
by accumulation. It would seem, however, that
he took the degree of B.D. only; so Dr John
Caius says, and he must be right, if it is true
that in the doctor's diploma which Erasmus
received at Turin in 1506 he was described as a
bachelor of theology. Had he possessed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
higher degree, it would have been mentioned in
the Turin document. During this second visit
he saw a good deal of More and other old
acquaintances. Grocyn took him to Lambeth,
and introduced him to Warham, Archbishop of
Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England,&mdash;who,
in the sequel, was one of his best friends.</p>

<p>He had now become able to realise the
dream of his youth&mdash;to visit Italy. It was
arranged that he should accompany the two
sons of Dr Baptista Boyer, chief physician to
Henry VII., who were going to Genoa; a royal
courier was to escort them as far as Bologna.
The party left Dover in the spring of 1506, and
were tossed about for four days in the Channel.
After a rest at Paris, they set out on horse-back
for Turin. Erasmus has vividly described
the squalid German inns, which he contrasts
with those of France. Another discomfort of
the journey was that the tutor and the courier
quarrelled a good deal. At Turin&mdash;his companions
having left him&mdash;he stayed several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
weeks, and received from the University the
degree of Doctor in Theology.</p>

<p>The stay of Erasmus in Italy lasted three
years&mdash;from the summer of 1506 to that of 1509.
It is well to remember what was the general
state of things in Italy at that time,&mdash;for the
impressions which Erasmus received there had
a strong and lasting effect upon his mind. In
literature the humanistic revival had now passed
its zenith, and was declining into that frivolous
pedantry which Erasmus afterwards satirised in
the 'Ciceronian.' Architecture, sculpture and
painting were indeed active; Bramante, Michael
Angelo and Raphael were at work. But the
fact which chiefly arrested the attention of
Erasmus was that Italian soil was the common
ground on which the princes of Europe were
prosecuting their intricate ambitions, and that
the Pope had unsheathed the sword in pursuit
of temporal advantage. Julius II. was already
an elderly man, but full of military ardour.
Venice seemed to be his ulterior object; mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>while,
in the autumn of 1506, he had reduced
Perugia and Bologna. Erasmus was in Bologna
when the Pope entered in November, and the
late roses of that strangely mild autumn were
strewn in his path by the shouting multitudes
who hailed him as a warrior equal to his Roman
namesake of old, the conqueror of Gaul.
Erasmus was at Rome, too, in the following
March, when the Pope celebrated his triumph
with a martial pomp which no Caesar could
have surpassed. Then came the revolt of Genoa
from France,&mdash;the futile war of Maximilian,
'Emperor Elect,' against Venice,&mdash;and lastly
the iniquitous League of Cambray, by which
Maximilian, the Pope, Louis XII. and Ferdinand
of Spain banded themselves together for the
spoliation of the Venetian Republic. Such
things as these sank deep into the heart of
Erasmus. 'When princes purpose to exhaust
a commonwealth'&mdash;he wrote afterwards&mdash;'they
speak of a just war; when they unite for that
object, they call it peace.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was a bright side also to his years
in Italy; in many places he enjoyed intercourse
with learned men; and he formed some enduring
friendships. At Venice he spent several months
with Aldus in 1508, and saw an enlarged
edition of the <i>Adagia</i> through his famous
press. The kind of reputation which he had
now won may be seen from his own account
of his visit to Cardinal Grimani at Rome, in
1509: it is a characteristic little story, and ought
to be told in his own words. 'There was no
one to be seen in the courtyard of the Cardinal's
palace,' he says, 'or in the entrance-hall.... I
went upstairs alone. I passed through the first,
the second, the third room;&mdash;still no one to be
seen, and not a door shut; I could not help
wondering at the solitude. Coming to the last
room, I there found only one person,&mdash;a Greek,
I thought,&mdash;a physician,&mdash;with his head shaved,
standing at the open door. I asked him if I
could see the Cardinal; he replied that he was
in an inner room, with some visitors. As I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
no more, he asked me my business. I replied,
'I wished to pay my respects to him, if it had
been convenient, but as he is engaged, I will
call again.' I was just going away, but paused
at a window to look at the view; the Greek
came back to me, and asked if I wished to leave
any message. 'You need not disturb him,' I
said,&mdash;'I will call again soon.' Then he asked
my name, and I told him. The instant he heard
it, before I could stop him, he hurried into the
inner room, and quickly returning, begged me
not to go&mdash;I should be admitted directly. The
Cardinal received me, not as a man of his high
degree might have received one of my humble
condition, but like an equal: a chair was placed
for me, and we conversed for more than two
hours. He would not even allow me to be
uncovered,&mdash;a wonderful condescension in a
man of his rank. Grimani pressed Erasmus to
stay permanently at Rome. But he replied that
he had just received a summons to England,
which left him no choice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>In the April of that year, 1509, the little
boy whom Erasmus had seen in the nursery at
Eltham had become Henry VIII.; and in May,
Mountjoy had written to his old tutor, urging
him to return. Erasmus reached England early
in the summer of 1510. Soon afterwards, in
More's house at Bucklersbury, he rapidly wrote
his famous satire, the <i>Encomium Moriac</i>, or
'Praise of Folly,' in which Folly celebrates her
own praises as the great source of human
pleasures. He had been meditating this piece
on the long journey from Rome; it is a kaleidoscope
of his experiences in Italy, and of earlier
memories. As to the title, <i>Moria</i>, the Greek
word for 'folly,' was a playful allusion, of course,
to the name of his wise and witty host. This
'Praise of Folly' is a satire, not only in the
modern but in the original sense of that word,&mdash;a
medley. All classes, all callings, are sportively
viewed on the weak side. But in relation to the
author's own life and times, the most important
topics are the various abuses in the Church, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
pedantries of the schoolmen, and the selfish wars
of kings. If this eloquent Folly, as Erasmus
presents her, most often wears the mocking smile
of Lucian or Voltaire, there are moments also
when she wields the terrible lash of Juvenal
or of Swift. The popularity of the satire,
throughout Europe, was boundless. The mask
of jest which it wore was its safeguard; how
undignified, how absurd it would have been
for a Pope or a King to care what was said by
Folly! And, just for that reason, the <i>Encomium
Moriae</i> must be reckoned among the forces
which prepared the Reformation.</p>

<p>Where was Erasmus to settle now? That
was the great question for him. He decided it
by going to Cambridge, on the invitation of
Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester, who was then
Chancellor of the University. Rooms were
assigned to him in Queens' College, of which
Fisher had been President a few years before.
In that beautiful old cloister at Queens', where
the spirit of the fifteenth century seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
linger, an entrance at the south-east corner
gives access to a small court which is known
as the court of Erasmus. His lodgings were in
a square turret of red brick at the south-east
angle of the court. His study was probably a
good-sized room which is now used as a lecture-room;
on the floor above this was his bedroom,
with an adjoining attic for his servant. From
the south windows of these rooms&mdash;looking on
the modern Silver Street&mdash;he had a wide view
over what was then open country, interspersed
with cornfields; the windings of the river could
be seen as far as the Trumpington woods. The
walk on the west side of the Cam, which is
called the walk of Erasmus, was not laid out till
1684: in his time it was open ground, with
probably no trees upon it. His first letter from
Cambridge is dated Dec. 1510, and this date
must be right, or nearly so. He says himself
that he taught Greek here before he lectured on
theology; and also that, after his arrival, the
commencement of his Greek teaching was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
delayed by ill-health. Now he was elected to
the Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity in
1511, and in those days the election was ordered
to take place on the last day of term before the
Long Vacation. His residence, then, can hardly
have begun later than the early part of 1511.</p>

<p>It is interesting to think of him&mdash;now a man
of forty-four, but prematurely old in appearance&mdash;moving
about the narrow streets or quiet
courts of that medieval Cambridge which was just
about to become the modern&mdash;a transformation
due, in no small measure, to the influence of his
own labours. Eleven of our Colleges existed.
Peterhouse was in the third century of its life;
others also were of a venerable age. Erasmus
would have heard the rumour that a house of
his own order, the Hospital of the Brethren of
St John, was about to be merged in a new and
more splendid foundation, the College of St John
the Evangelist. Where Trinity College now
stands, he would have seen the separate institutions
which, after another generation, were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
be united by Henry VIII.; he would have seen
a hostel of the Benedictines where Magdalene
College was soon to arise; the Franciscans on
the site of Sidney Sussex, and the Dominicans
on the site of Emmanuel. North of Queens'
College, he would have found the convent of the
Carmelites; and then, rising in lonely majesty&mdash;with
no other College buildings as yet on its
south side&mdash;the chapel of King's, completed as
to the walls, but not yet roofed.</p>

<p>When Erasmus began his Greek lectures in
his rooms at Queens', his text-book was the
elementary grammar of Manuel Chrysoloras,
entitled the 'Questions',&mdash;which had been the
standard book all through the fifteenth century.
He next took up the larger and more advanced
grammar of Theodorus Gaza, published in 1495,&mdash;which
he afterwards translated into Latin.
We have a specimen of his own Greek composition
at this period. In 1511 he went from
Cambridge to visit the celebrated shrine of the
Virgin at Walsingham in Norfolk&mdash;the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
where, two years later, Queen Catherine gave
thanks after the battle of Flodden. As a votive
offering, he hung up on the wall a short set of
Greek iambics, which are extant: they are to the
effect that, while others bring rich gifts and crave
worldly blessings, he asks only for a pure heart.
There are some faults of metre, but the diction
is classical and idiomatic: probably no one in
Europe at that time, unless it were Budaeus,
could have written better. When Erasmus revisited
Walsingham a little later, he found that
these verses had sorely puzzled the monks and
their friends; there had been much wiping of
eye-glasses; and opinions differed as to whether
the characters were Arabic, or purely arbitrary.
Erasmus did not get many hearers for his Greek
lectures, and was rather disappointed; but some,
at least, of his pupils were ardent; thus he describes
Henry Bullock of Queens'&mdash;the 'Bovillus'
of his letters&mdash;as 'working hard at Greek.' And
the impulse which he gave can be judged from
the rapid progress of the new learning at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Cambridge. Writing to him in 1516&mdash;three
years after he had left&mdash;Bullock says, 'people
here are devoting themselves eagerly to Greek
literature.' In a letter to Everard, the Stadtholder
of Holland, in 1520, Erasmus says:&mdash;'Theology
is flourishing at Paris and at Cambridge
as nowhere else: and why? Because
they are adapting themselves to the tendencies
of the age; because the new studies, which are
ready, if need be, to storm an entrance, are not
repelled by them as foes, but received as welcome
guests.' In another letter he remarks that, while
Greek studies have been instituted in both the
English Universities, at Cambridge they are
pursued peacefully (<i>tranquille</i>),&mdash;owing, he says,
to Fisher's influence. He is alluding to those
struggles at Oxford between the adherents of
the schoolmen and the new learning which came
to a head in the 'Trojan' and 'Grecian' riots of
1519, and led to Wolsey's founding the readership
of Greek. Oxford had been, in England,
the great theological University of the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
ages, and the scholastic system died hardest
there.</p>

<p>Erasmus taught Greek without any formal
appointment, so far as we know, from the
University; though Fisher, the Chancellor, may
have arranged that he should receive a stipend.
The first man formally appointed Greek reader
was Richard Croke in 1519; who speaks, indeed,
of Erasmus as having been 'professor of Greek,'
but probably means simply lecturer. The official
status of Erasmus was that of Lady Margaret
Professor of Divinity. The election to the Chair
was then biennial. At the end of his term&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
in the summer of 1513&mdash;Erasmus was re-elected.
This is a noteworthy fact. The electing body
comprised the whole Faculty of Theology,
regulars as well as seculars. The 'Praise of
Folly' must by that time have been well-known
here. If Erasmus was not universally acceptable
to the schoolmen or to the monks of
Cambridge, at any rate the general respect for
his character and attainments carried the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>When we try to imagine him in his rooms
at Queens', we are not to picture him as a
popular teacher, with the youth of the university
crowding to learn from him; his life here was
that of a recluse student, in weak health, whose
surroundings were in some respects uncongenial
to him, but who had a group of devoted pupils,
and some chosen older friends. From 1508 to
the end of his life he suffered from a painful
organic disease, which obliged him to be careful
of his diet. When he dined in the old College
hall at Queens', above the west cloister&mdash;now
part of the President's Lodge&mdash;the ghosts of the
College benefactors, whose heads are carved on
the oak wainscoting, would have been grieved
if they could have known what he thought of
Cambridge beverages; he writes to his Italian
friend Ammonius&mdash;afterwards Latin Secretary
to Henry VIII.&mdash;begging for a cask of Greek
wine. His favourite exercise was riding; and
he made frequent excursions. Meanwhile he
accomplished a surprising amount of work. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was busy with the text of Seneca, with translations
from Basil, with Latin manuals for St
Paul's School, just founded by his friend Colet&mdash;and
with much else. It was here that he began
revising the text of Jerome's works. 'My mind
is in such a glow over Jerome,' he writes, 'that
I could fancy myself actually inspired.' But
there is one labour above all that entitles those
rooms in the old tower at Queens' to be reckoned
among the sacred places of literature. It was
there in 1512 that the Lady Margaret Professor
completed a collation of the Greek Text of the
New Testament. Four years later, his edition&mdash;the
first ever published&mdash;appeared at Basle.</p>

<p>In 1513 Cambridge was visited by the plague,
and nearly every one fled from it. During some
months of the autumn, Erasmus had scarcely
heard a foot-fall in the cloister beneath his
rooms. At the end of the year, he finally
left the University. Some of his reasons for
going can be conjectured from his letters.
They express disappointment with England;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and they speak of poverty. It is well to observe
the sense in which these complaints are to be
understood. After 1510 Erasmus was never
actually indigent. Archbishop Warham had
offered him the Rectory of Aldington in Kent;
Erasmus declined it, because he could not speak
English&mdash;he never learned any modern language,
and besides his own vernacular, spoke Latin
only: then Warham gave him a pension from
the benefice. Fisher and Mountjoy were also
liberal. At Cambridge, with these resources, and
the stipend of his Chair, it has been computed
that his income must have been equivalent to
about £700 at the present day. But his mode
of living, though not profuse, was not frugal.
Thus he himself enumerates the following heads
of his expenditure;&mdash;servants ('<i>famulorum</i>')&mdash;the
aid of amanuenses&mdash;the cost of keeping a
horse, or horses (ιπποτροφἱá)&mdash;frequent journeys&mdash;and
social or charitable obligations: he
disliked, he says, to be penurious ('<i>hic animus
abhorrens a sordibus</i>'). The fact seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
be that he had formed exaggerated hopes of
what Henry VIII. would do for him. His
immediate motive for departure, however, was
probably the desire to supervise the printing of
the Greek Testament. There was then no
English press where such a work could be done
so well as abroad. He had heard that Froben,
the famous printer at Basle, was about to publish
the works of Jerome; and to Basle he went.
Another circumstance helped to decide him.
Prince Charles,&mdash;afterwards the Emperor Charles
V.,&mdash;had offered him the post of honorary privy-councillor,
with a pension,&mdash;and this without
binding him to live in the Netherlands. At this
time Erasmus would have been welcomed in
any country of Europe; Cardinal Canossa, the
Papal legate, was anxious to secure him for
Rome. At a later period, when his fame stood
yet higher, Henry VIII. would have been glad
to lure him back; but it was then too late.</p>

<p>So, in 1514, Erasmus left England&mdash;not to
return, except for a few months in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
year. He was now forty-seven. Twenty-two
years of life remained to him. The history of
these years is essentially that of his untiring
and astonishing literary activity. In his external
life there is little to record beyond changes of
residence,&mdash;from Basle to the University of
Louvain in Brabant,&mdash;from Louvain back to
Basle,&mdash;from Basle to Freiburg,&mdash;and once more
to Basle, where, in 1536, he died. The clue
to this later period is given by two threads,
which are indeed but strands of a single cord,&mdash;his
influence on the revival of learning, and
his attitude towards the Reformation.</p>

<p>In the younger days of Erasmus the Italian
cultivation of classical literature had attained its
highest point, and was already verging towards
decline. More than a century had passed since
Petrarch had kindled the first enthusiasm. It
requires some effort of the imagination for us
to realise what that movement meant. The men
of the fourteenth century lived under a Church
which claimed the surrender of the reason, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
only in matters of faith, but in all knowledge:
philosophy and science could speak only by the
doctors whom she sanctioned. When the fourteenth
century began to study the classics, the
first feeling was one of joy in the newly revealed
dignity of the human mind; it was a strange
and delightful thing, as they gradually came to
know the great writers of ancient Greece and
Rome, to see the reason moving freely, exploring,
speculating, discussing, without restraint.
And then those children of the middle age were
surprised and charmed by the forms of classical
expression,&mdash;so different from anything that had
been familiar to them. Borrowing an old Latin
word, they called this new learning <i>humanity</i>;
for them, however, the phrase had a depth of
meaning undreamt of by Cicero. Now, for the
first time, they felt that they had entered into
full possession of themselves; nothing is more
characteristic of the Italian renaissance than the
self-asserting individuality of the chief actors;
each strives to throw the work of his own spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
into relief; the common life falls into the background;
the history of that age is the history of
men rather than of communities.</p>

<p>In the progress of this Italian humanism
three chief phases may be roughly distinguished.
The first closes with the end of the
fourteenth century,&mdash;the time of Petrarch and
his immediate followers,&mdash;the morning-time of
discovery. Then, in the first half of the fifteenth
century, the discovered materials were classified,
and organised in great libraries; Greek manuscripts,
too, were translated into Latin,&mdash;not
that the versions might be taken as substitutes
for the original, but to aid the study of Greek
itself. The men of this second period were
gathered around Cosmo de' Medici at Florence,
or Nicholas V. at Rome. The third stage
was that in which criticism, both of form
and of matter, was carried to a higher level,
chiefly by the joint efforts of scholars grouped
in select societies or academies, such as the
Platonic academy at Florence, of which Ficino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was the centre. The greatest man of this time,&mdash;the
greatest genius of the literary renaissance
in Italy,&mdash;was Angelo Poliziano; he died in
1494, when Erasmus was twenty-seven.</p>

<p>With Erasmus a new period opens. Two
things broadly distinguish him, as a scholar,
from the men before and after him. First, he
was not only a refined humanist, writing for the
fastidious few, and prizing no judgment but
theirs; he took the most profitable authors of
antiquity,&mdash;profitable in a moral as well as a
literary sense,&mdash;chose out the best things in
them,&mdash;and sought to make these things widely
known,&mdash;applying their wisdom or wit to the
circumstances of his own day. Secondly, in all
his work he had an educational aim,&mdash;and this
of the largest kind. The evils of his age,&mdash;in
Church, in State, in the daily lives of men,&mdash;seemed
to him to have their roots in ignorance,&mdash;ignorance
of what Christianity meant,&mdash;ignorance
of what the Bible taught,&mdash;ignorance of
what the noblest and most gifted minds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
past, whether Christian or pagan, had contributed
to the instruction of the human race. Let true
knowledge only spread, and under its enlightening
and humanising influence a purer religion
and a better morality will gradually prevail.
Erasmus was a man of the world; but with his
keen intellect, so quickly susceptible to all
impressions, he made the mistake, not uncommon
for such temperaments, of overrating
the rapidity with which intellectual influences
permeate the masses of mankind. However, no
one was ever more persistently or brilliantly
true to an idea than Erasmus was to his; and
it is wonderful how much he achieved.</p>

<p>His services to the new learning took various
forms. He wrote school-books, bringing out his
view that boys were kept too long over grammar,
and ought to begin reading some good author as
soon as possible. His own <i>Colloquies</i> were meant
partly as models of colloquial Latin; the book
was long a standard one in education. These
lively dialogues are prose idylls with an ethical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
purpose,&mdash;the dramatic expression of the writer's
views on the life of the day. Thus the dialogue
between the Learned Lady and the Abbot depicts
monastic illiteracy; that between the Soldier
and the Carthusian brings out the seamy side of
the military calling. Lucian has influenced the
form; but the dramatic skill which blends
earnestness with humour is the author's own;
there are touches here and there which might
fairly be called Shakspearian. Then he made
collections of striking thoughts and fine passages
in the classics. His chief book of this kind was
the <i>Adagia</i>. Many of the classical proverbs are
made texts for little essays on the affairs of the
day. Thus he takes up a Latin proverb, 'The
beetle pursues the eagle'&mdash;based on the fable of
the beetle avenging itself for an insult by destroying
the eagle's eggs&mdash;the moral being that
the most exalted wrong-doer is never safe from
the vengeance of the humblest victim. This
suggests to him an ingenious satire on the misdeeds
of great princes&mdash;typified by the eagle&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>and
their results. Later in life, he brought out
the <i>Apophthegms</i>&mdash;a collection of good sayings,
chiefly from Plutarch. His editions of classical
authors were numerous: the best was that of
Terence,&mdash;his favourite poet; the next best was
that of Seneca. His principal editions of Greek
authors belong to the last five years of his life,
and were less important. Speaking of these
editions generally, we may say that they were
valuable in two ways,&mdash;by making the authors
themselves more accessible, and by furnishing
improved texts. Then he made many Latin
translations from Greek poetry and prose.
Mention is due also to his dialogue on the pronunciation
of Greek and Latin,&mdash;published in
1528. It was especially a protest against the
confusion of the vowels in the modern Greek
pronunciation, and against the modern disregard
of quantity in favour of the stress accent. His
views ultimately fixed the continental pronunciation
of Greek, which is still known in Greece
by his name (ἡ 'Ερáσμου προφορá). At Cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>bridge
it was introduced a little later by Thomas
Smith and John Cheke. Along with this
dialogue appeared another,&mdash;the amusing <i>Ciceronian</i>.
It is an appeal to common-sense against
an absurd affectation which marked the dotage
of Italian humanism. Bembo and his disciples
would not use a single word or phrase which
did not occur in Cicero. Their purism moreover
rejected all modern terms: a Cardinal became
an 'augur,' a nun a 'vestal,' the Papal tiara was
'the fillet of Romulus.' Most ludicrous of all,
because Cicero was a statesman, the modern
Ciceronian, writing to his friends from the
profound seclusion of his study, deemed it a
stylistic duty to imply that he lived in a vortex
of politics. The gist of what Erasmus says is
merely that other ancients besides Cicero wrote
good Latin, and that a true Ciceronianism would
adjust itself to its surroundings. No one, it
should be added, had a more intelligent admiration
for Cicero than Erasmus himself.</p>

<p>We see, then, the peculiar place which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
holds in the history of the new learning. It
may be allowed that, if the study of classical
antiquity be viewed as a progressive science, he
did much less to advance it than was done by
some other great scholars of a later period. He
did not enlarge the boundaries of knowledge in
that field as they were afterwards enlarged by
the special labours of Joseph Scaliger, of Isaac
Casaubon, or of Richard Bentley. But the work
which Erasmus did was one which, at that time,
was of the first necessity for the northern nations.
In his genial, popular way he made
them feel the value and charm of the classics
as literature; he himself was, in fact, a learned
man of letters rather than a critical specialist.
Let us remember what the state of northern
Europe, as regards literature, was in his boyhood.
It was sunk,&mdash;to use his own words,&mdash;in
utter barbarism. To know Greek was the next
thing to heresy. 'I did my best,' he says, 'to
deliver the rising generation from this slough of
ignorance, and to inspire them with a taste for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
better studies. I wrote, not for Italy, but for
Germany and the Netherlands.'</p>

<p>The circulation of his more popular writings,
all over Europe, was so enormous that one can
compare it only to that of some widely-read
modern journal, or of some extraordinarily
popular novel. For instance, a Paris bookseller
once heard, or invented, a rumour that the
Sorbonne was going to condemn the <i>Colloquies</i>
of Erasmus as heretical; and, being a shrewd
man, he instantly printed a new edition of 24,000
copies. A moral treatise by Erasmus, called
the <i>Enchiridion</i> ('the Christian Soldier's Dagger'),
which was a favourite alike with Catholics
and with Protestants, was translated into every
language of Europe. A Spanish ecclesiastic,
writing in 1527, declares that a version of it was
in the hands of all classes throughout Spain,&mdash;even
the smallest country inn could usually
show a copy. It may be doubted whether any
author's works were ever so frequently reprinted
within his life-time as were those of Erasmus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
And wherever his books went, they carried with
them the influence of his spirit,&mdash;his love of
good literature, his loyalty to reason, his quiet
common-sense, his hatred of war, his versatile
wit, nourished by varied observation of life,&mdash;wit
which could play gracefully around the
slightest theme, or strike with a keen edge at
falsehood and wrong,&mdash;his desire to make it felt
that a good life is not an affair of formal observance,
but must begin in the heart.</p>

<p>The works which entitle Erasmus to be
called the parent of Biblical criticism are connected
with his secular studies by a closer tie
than might appear at first sight. His principal
concern was always with literature as such; he
was, moreover, a practical moralist, anxious to
aid in correcting the evils of his time: but he
was not distinctively a theologian; and towards
dogmatic theology, in particular, he had little
inclination. Now, in pursuing his paramount
aim&mdash;to make the world better by the humanising
influences of literature&mdash;the enemy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which he had to do battle was the scholastic
philosophy. Hear his words when he is asking
how Christians are to convert Turks:&mdash;'Shall
we put into their hands an Occam, a Durandus,
a Scotus, a Gabriel, or an Alvarus? What will
they think of us, when they hear of our perplexed
subtleties about Instants, Formalities, Quiddities,
and Relations?' This was the dreary wilderness
of pedantry that had hitherto passed for
knowledge. And the scholastic philosophy was
securely entrenched behind the scholastic theology.
The weapons of that theology were
Biblical texts, isolated from their context, and
artificially interpreted: the one way to disarm
it was to make men know what the Bible really
said and meant. Therefore Erasmus felt that
his first duty, both as a moralist and as a man
of letters, was to promote a knowledge of the
Bible. He was not a Hebrew scholar, and could
do nothing at first hand with the Old Testament;
that province was left to Reuchlin. But in 1516
he published the Greek Testament,&mdash;the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
edition which had appeared; for the Complutensian
edition, though printed two years earlier,
was not issued till 1522. He also wrote a new
Latin version of the New Testament, endeavouring
to make it more exact than the Vulgate;
and added notes. Further, he wrote a series of
Latin Paraphrases on all the books of the New
Testament except Revelation. These were
intended to exhibit the substance and thought
of the several books in a more modern form,
and so to bring them home more directly to the
ordinary reader's mind. The paraphrases were
presently translated into English, and every
Parish Church in England was furnished with
a copy. In the remarkable 'Exhortation' prefixed
to his Greek Testament, Erasmus observes
that, while the disciples of every other philosophy
derive it from the fountain-head, the Christian
doctrine alone is not studied at its source. He
would like to see the Scriptures translated into
every language, and put into the hands of all.
'I long,' he says, 'that the husbandman should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sing them to himself as he follows the plough,
that the weaver should hum them to the tune of
his shuttle, that the traveller should beguile with
them the weariness of his journey.' Then, as
to interpretation,&mdash;from the medieval expositors,
the schoolmen, he appealed to the primitive
interpreters, the Fathers of the early Church,
who stood nearer to those documents alike in
time and in spirit. And first of all to Jerome;
for Jerome had essayed, in the fourth century, a
work analogous to that which Erasmus was
attempting in the sixteenth. Thus it was
fitting that his edition of Jerome should appear
almost simultaneously with his Greek Testament.
He afterwards edited other Latin Fathers;
and it was through his translations from the
Greek Fathers, especially Chrysostom and
Athanasius, that their writings first became
better known in the West.</p>

<p>So far, all that Erasmus had said and done
was in accord with that general movement
of thought which led up to the Reformation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
When Luther came forward, it was expected
by many that Erasmus would place himself at
his side. But Erasmus never departed an inch
from his allegiance to Rome; and in the year
before his death Paul III., in appointing him
Provost of Deventer, formally acknowledged the
services which he had rendered in combating
the new opinions. It is important to see as
clearly as possible what his position was.</p>

<p>Luther made his protest at Wittenberg in
1517. For four years after that, Erasmus hoped
that the matter might be peaceably adjusted.
Luther was personally a stranger to him, but
had a great admiration for his work, and wrote
to him, as to an intellectual leader of whose
sympathy he hoped that he might feel sure;
Erasmus wrote back kindly, but guardedly,
urging counsels of moderation. When Frederick
of Saxony consulted him, he spoke in Luther's
favour. But after 1521 all hopes of conciliation
were at an end: peace between Rome and
Luther was thenceforth impossible. And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
both sides began to press Erasmus. The
Romanists cried, 'This is all your doing; as
the monks say, you laid the egg, and Luther
has hatched it: you must now lose no time in
speaking out, and making it clear that you are
loyal to the Church of which you are a priest.'
The Lutherans said: 'You know that you agree
with us in your heart; you yourself have made
a scathing exposure of the very abuses which
we are attacking; be true to yourself, and take
your place among our leaders.' Erasmus suffered,
but remained silent. At last he decided
to write against Luther, and in 1524 published
his treatise on Free Will. Luther held that,
owing to original sin, divine grace alone can turn
man's will to good; Erasmus defended the doctrine
of the Church, that, while grace is the
indispensable and principal agent, the will is so
far free as to allow for some human merit in
preferring good to evil. Luther replied, and
Erasmus rejoined. Thenceforth the Lutherans
regarded Erasmus as an opponent;&mdash;some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
them, as a traitor; while his own side felt that
he had not done them much good. For the question
handled by him, however important in itself,
was not the question of the hour. And indeed
many will feel that this particular controversy
was the greatest mistake in the life of Erasmus.
Not because he entered the lists against Luther&mdash;it
is intelligible that he should have felt himself
constrained to do so&mdash;but because, having
decided to fight, he did not raise the main issue.
That issue was,&mdash;Which is the greater evil,&mdash;to
endure the corruptions, or to rebel? It was
open to him to contend that rebellion was the
greater: but, if he was not prepared to enter on
that ground, then it would have been better to
keep silence.</p>

<p>What were the trains of thought and feeling
which determined his course at that great crisis?
A careful study of his own utterances will show
that the considerations which swayed him were
of three distinct kinds; we might describe them
as ecclesiastical, intellectual, and personal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, it is apparent that Erasmus
regarded the prospect of schism, not only from
a churchman's point of view, but also as a danger
to social order. He thinks of the Roman Church
under the image of a temporal State. Grave
abuses have indeed crept into the constitution,
but the State contains within itself the only
legitimate agencies for reform. A citizen is
entitled to lift up his voice against the abuses;
but his loyalty to the head of the State must
remain intact; if that head delays or declines to
interfere, the citizen must be patient. And,
even in denouncing evils, he must consider
whether there is not a point at which denunciation,
as tending to excite turbulence, may not
do more harm than good. Such a view was the
more natural in an age when men's minds had
so long been familiar with the conception which
was the basis of the Holy Roman Empire. No
faults in any grade of the ecclesiastical hierarchy
could do away with the feeling that Pope and
Emperor were, by divine appointment, the joint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
guardians of human welfare, and that a revolt
against the authority of the Church was an
assault on the framework which held society
together. The peculiar attitude of Erasmus,&mdash;his
reluctance to take part in the conflict, and
the attacks made on him from both sides,&mdash;gave
to his conduct the appearance of greater irresolution
than can justly be laid to his charge.
About one thing&mdash;this should be distinctly remembered&mdash;he
never wavered. He never at
any moment contemplated rebellion against the
authority of Rome; he was as remote from that
as were the two English friends whose views as
to the abuses in the Church most nearly agreed
with his own, John Colet and Thomas More.
The real source of his embarrassment was that
he approved, in a large measure, of Luther's
objects, while he strongly disapproved of his
methods.</p>

<p>Further, he disliked the Lutheran movement
as threatening to impede the quiet progress of
literature, and this in two ways,&mdash;first, by creating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a general turmoil,&mdash;secondly, by giving the
schoolmen and the monks a pretext for saying
that the new learning was a source of social
disorder. There is a striking letter of his,
written to Alberto Pio, Prince of Carpi, in 1525.
He points out that the foes of the new learning
had been most anxious to identify it with the
Lutheran cause, in order to damage two enemies
at once. Then, further,&mdash;he disliked all appeals
to passion, or blind partisanship; his hope for
the world was in the growing sway of reason.
Two hundred and fifty years afterwards, another
gifted mind, in looking back, took much the
same view that Erasmus had taken in looking
forward. Goethe deplored Luther's violence.
But Luther might have quoted Ajax. To
dream that such evils could be cured by the
gentle magic of literature was indeed to chant
incantations over a malady that craved the
surgeon's knife.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, some critics
of Erasmus ascribed his attitude to worldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
motives; but this was unjust, as many details of
his life show. When Paul III. wished to make
him a Cardinal, and to provide him with the
necessary income, he declined. He was ambitious
of praise, but not of wealth or rank.
Personal considerations influenced him only in
this sense, that he knew his own unfitness for
the part of a leader or a combatant at such a
time. His right place was in his study, and he
grudged every hour lost to his proper work. 'I
would rather work for a month at expounding
St Paul,' he said to a correspondent, 'than waste
a day in quarrelling.' In character and temperament
he was the most perfect contrast to
Luther. We remember the story of Luther
being awakened in the night by a noise in his
room; he lit a candle, but could find nothing;
he then became certain that the invisible Enemy
of his soul was present in that room,&mdash;and yet he
lay down, and went calmly to sleep. There is
the essence of the man&mdash;the intensely vivid
sense of the supernatural, and the instinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
recourse to it as an explanation&mdash;and the absolute
faith. Erasmus was once in a town where
a powder-magazine exploded, and destroyed a
house which had harboured evil-doers; some
one remarked that this showed the divine anger
against guilt; Erasmus quietly answered that,
if such anger was indeed there, it was rather
against the folly which had built a powder-magazine
so near a town. The man who said
that could never have fought at Luther's
side.</p>

<p>Erasmus was a great literary precursor of
the Reformation; he armed the hands of the
Lutherans: but to call him, as some have done,
a Reformer before the Reformation, seems hardly
an appropriate description. If, in our own day,
those who are denominated Old Catholics had
confined themselves to urging the advisability of
certain reforms, without disputing the authority
of the Pope or proposing to secede from communion
with Rome, their position would have
been analogous to that of Erasmus. Viewed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a whole, his conduct was essentially consistent
and independent.</p>

<p>His imperishable claim to the gratitude of
the world, and especially of the Teutonic peoples,
rests on the part which he sustained in a contest
of even larger scope than that waged by Luther,&mdash;in
the great preliminary conflict between the
old and the new conception of knowledge, between
the bondage and the enfranchisement of
the human mind, between a lifeless formalism
in religion and the spirit of practical Christianity.
From youth to old age, through many
trials, he worked with indomitable energy in
the cause of light; and it was his great reward,
that, before he died, he saw the dawn of a new
age beginning for the nations of the north,&mdash;not
without clouds and storm, but with the
assurance that the reign of darkness was past.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
